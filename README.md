# Example-App

Got sick of making landing pages, plus needed a reason to apply JavaScript so I decided to start the Example App series. Today's example app is a watch app, which will incorporate the time, a stopwatch, and a timer. Tomorrow I will try to add the stopwatch and timer. I will also start making dynamic landing pages in the near future.
