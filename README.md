# Example-App

Got sick of making landing pages, plus needed a reason to apply JavaScript so I decided to start the Example App series. Today's example app is a watch app, which will incorporate the time, a stopwatch, and a timer. Tomorrow I will try to add the stopwatch and timer. I will also start making dynamic landing pages in the near future.

Update 7/10: The stopwatch completely works with the exception of starting and stopping again without resetting. Guess I'll add it if I have time, will do the timer tomorrow.

Update 7/12: Finished the app, very proud cause it's my first real project incorporating JavaScript completely organically; although improvements could be made, definitely a good start.
